# Include-Files <h><h/>

Include files for C++!<br><br>
Okay, yes, I know. There are probably better ones than this. I'm just doing this for fun though. :) <br><br>

# Quick Guide <h><h/>
Here's a quick run through. <br>
Clicking on a folder leads you to one of the include files. Each folder contains `main.cpp` and `something.h` where something is the name of the include file. `main.cpp` is an example of using it, while `something.h` (where something is the name of the include file) is the actual file. <br><br>
